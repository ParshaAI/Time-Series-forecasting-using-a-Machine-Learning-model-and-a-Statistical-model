# Time-Series-forecasting-using-a-Machine-Learning-model-and-a-Statistical-model

This project aims to forecast hydrogen production trends using advanced time series modeling techniques, specifically SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models. Although the original goal was to analyze five European countries — Germany, Denmark, Spain, Norway, and Austria — data availability constraints led to a focused study on Germany.

Project Objectives

- Develop and compare two forecasting models (SARIMA and LSTM) for predicting hydrogen production.
- Provide insights into the evolving hydrogen production landscape in Germany.
- Explore how dataset size and quality influence model performance.
- Support global decarbonization efforts with reliable forecasting tools.

 Models Used
 
- SARIMA: A classical statistical model suitable for capturing linear trends and seasonal patterns in time series data.
- LSTM: A type of recurrent neural network capable of learning complex, non-linear dependencies in sequential data.

Key Findings

-LSTM outperformed SARIMA in terms of prediction accuracy, especially in handling non-linear patterns.
-Dataset size and quality play a critical role in model performance — more reliable and extensive data leads to better forecasts.
